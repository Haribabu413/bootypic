 * Each pin should have three defines associated with it:
 *   * port
 *   * pin number
 *   * RP assignment
 * 
 * Assign the port by defining RX_PORT_A, RX_PORT_B, etc.
 * Assign the pin by defining RX_PIN 1, RX_PIN 2, etc.
 * Assign the remappable input by define RX_RPNUM to an RP number
 * 
 * Same pattern for TX pins.
 * 
 * If the pin has not been utilized before, it may be necessary to add this 
 * bit to the source code as well, but in those places, it should be clear
 * what the user should do in the source code to make compatible with their
